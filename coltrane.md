John Coltrane

Coltrane was born in his parents' apartment at 200 Hamlet Avenue in Hamlet, North Carolina, on September 23, 1926.[5] His father was John R. Coltrane[6] and his mother was Alice Blair.[7] He grew up in High Point, North Carolina and attended William Penn High School. Beginning in December 1938, his father, aunt, and grandparents died within a few months of each other, leaving him to be raised by his mother and a close cousin.[8] In June 1943, he moved to Philadelphia. In September, his mother bought him his first saxophone, an alto.[7] He played clarinet and alto horn in a community band before beginning alto saxophone in high school. From early to mid-1945 he had his first professional work: a "cocktail lounge trio" with piano and guitar.[9]
